#class object atrribute doesn't change arounnd it's instances and always remains static.
# A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.
# Class variable âˆ’ A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined
 # within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.
